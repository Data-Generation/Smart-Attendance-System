# Smart-Attendance-System
Maintaining the attendance record with day-to-day activities is a challenging task. The conventional method of calling the name of each student is time-consuming as well as preserving hard copy data increases the chances of errors and its complexity. The following system is based on face recognition to record the attendance of students.

	Creating a dataset by facial detection of different people.
	Embedding the images to provide to machine learning model for training.
	Training the machine learning model on our dataset 
	Recognizing a person through live stream.
	Constant updating of the database upon recognizing a student followed by forwarding the attendance to the concerned faculty
	Creating a GUI-based application through Tkinter for an effortless user experience.
